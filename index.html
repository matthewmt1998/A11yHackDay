            <h3>Dyslexia Overview</h3>
            <hr class="my-4" />
            <ul id="doobie">
              <li>Dyslexia is a common learning difficulty that can cause problems with reading, writing and spelling.</li>
              <li>It's a "specific learning difficulty", which means it causes problems with certain abilities used for learning,
                such as reading and writing. Unlike a learning disability, intelligence isn't affected.</li>
              <li>It's estimated that up to 1 in every 10 to 20 people in the UK has some degree of dyslexia.</li>
              <li>Dyslexia is lifelong problem that can present challenges on a daily basis, but support is available to improve
                reading and writing skills and help those with the problem be successful at school and work.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>What are the signs of dyslexia?</h4>
            <p>Signs of dyslexia usually become apparent when a child starts school and begins to focus more on learning how
              to read and write.
              <br/>A person with dyslexia may:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>read and write very slowly</li>
              <li>confuse the order of letters in words</li>
              <li>put letters the wrong way round â€“ such as writing "b" instead of "d"</li>
              <li>have poor or inconsistent spelling</li>
              <li>understand information when told verbally, but have difficulty with information that's written down</li>
              <li>find it hard to carry out a sequence of directions</li>
              <li>struggle with planning and organisation</li>
              <li>However, people with dyslexia often have good skills in other areas, such as creative thinking and problem
                solving.
              </li>
            </ul>
                <h4>What causes dyslexia?</h4>
                <p>People with dyslexia find it difficult to recognise the different sounds that make up words and relate these
                  to letters. Dyslexia isn't related to a person's general level of intelligence. Children and adults of
                  all intellectual abilities can be affected by dyslexia. The exact cause of dyslexia is unknown, but it
                  often appears to run in families. In people with dyslexia, it's thought that certain genes inherited from
                  your parents may act together in a way that affects how some parts of brain develop during early life.
                </p>
