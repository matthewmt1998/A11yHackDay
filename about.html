    <h3>Case Study</h3>

    <p>

        Goverment Case study on Simmone, who is 41 and lives with her husband and their 2 sons in Brentford. She works as an office
        manager for Brentford council, and likes walking her dog in her spare time. A quote from Simmone: &quot;My spellingâ€™s
        bad and forms take me ages to fill in, but I have to get things right in my job and the software I use helps me a
        lot.&quot; </p>
